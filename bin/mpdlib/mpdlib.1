.SH NAME
mpdlib \- manage multiple mpd libraries

.SH SYNOPSIS
mpdlib [-ugv] [LIBRARY]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBmpdlib\fR allows for switching between multiple libraries in mpd relatively
seamlessly.
.PP
Configuration is set via \fBmpdlib.conf(5)\fR\&. The script first searches for
it at \fB${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:~/.config}/mpd/mpdlib.conf\fR then at
\fB/etc/mpd.d/mpdlib.conf\fR\&. Note that when running at a global level, only
\fB/etc/mpd.d/mpdlib.conf\fR will be used.
.PP
By default, \fBmpdlib\fR will look for a running \fBmpd\fR service process first
at the user level followed by the global level, and choose whether to operate at
the user or global level based on that. If \fBmpd\fR is not running,
\fBmpdlib\fR will check whether \fBmpd\fR is enabled at the user or global level
at \fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/systemd/user/default.target.wants/mpd.service\fR
and \fB/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/mpd.service\fR respectively.
If \fBmpd\fR is not running or enabled, \fBmpdlib\fR will default to user level
if run by a normal user and global level if run by root. However, it is possible
to override this behavior with the flags \fB-u\fR and \fB-s\fR\&.
